This project implements a modular momentum‐based factor investing engine that pulls monthly price data, generates 12×1 momentum signals, regression based and other custom variations, and backtests long–short decile portfolios with performance and turnover analytics. Future work will add support for additional factor types, incorporate advanced backtesting methods such as Combinatorial Purged Cross‐Validation (CPCV), and explore signal‐combination and portfolio optimization techniques. I will also integrate explicit turnover and transaction‐cost modeling to produce more realistic net‐return estimates.
